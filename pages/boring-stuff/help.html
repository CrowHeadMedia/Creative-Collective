    <h2 id="top-para">How to use our site?</h2>
    <h3>Homepage:  <a href="../../index.html">(click here to access the homepage)</a></h3>
      <p>
        The homepage can be accesed by pushing the back arrow in the top left of most pages, or by clicking the link above<br><br>
        It is divided into 12 boxes that can be used to navigate the pages of this site. The first box can redirect you to our 'About Us' page where you can learn more about the creative collective. The white boxes (10 in total) will redirect you to a page dedicated to each artist of the creative collective.<br><br>
        Three images are used to represent the artists, the first (the left larger one) shows an illustration of the artist, the two to the right of the artist give an insight into what their bsuiness is about. Underneath is the artists name in bold and their artistic type just underneath. You can click on any part of each square to direct yourself to their pages. When escaping their page, you can use the aforementioned back arrow in the top left to navigate back to the homepage. <br><br>
        The final section of the homepage is listed 'the other stuff', this includes the 'Help' page, the 'Privacy Policy', and the 'Terms & Conditions'. If there are any issues navigating this site refer to the emails down below.
      </p><br>

    <h3>Individual Pages:</h3>
      <p>Each individual page has been curated to represent the artist its symbolising, through aesthetics, images and texts. You can navigate to the page of each artist by clicking on their respective square on the homepage.<br><br>
        When viewing the work of each artist on the slideshow on their page, use the '❮' and '❯' arrows to change images. The slideshows, unfortunately do not currenlty support swipe movement. (Alternatively, smaller thumbnail images can be used to switch through the slides, though this feature isnt available on all pages). <br><br>
        To contact the artists, you can refer to their individual linktrees (which can be found as an interactive button under their summary) or their 'Contacts' section at the bottom of the pages. <br>
        <br>NOTE: not all artists have the same levels of contact methods, some solely use instagram or email, this will be shown by what is available in their 'Contacts' section.
      </p> <br>
